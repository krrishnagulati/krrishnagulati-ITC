# question 4

#  to produce 75 as string 
a = 25 # a is integer data type
b ="25" # b is string data type
c =25.0 # c is float data type 
#  here a,b,c and result are variables declared
a =int(a) #using typecasting function a,b,c are converted into integer data type
b =int(b)
c =int(c)
result = str(a+b+c)
print(result)
